# COVID-19 Research Paper Ranking using Natural Language Processing

## Use:

There are more than 100K research papers published on COVID-19. It is impossible for a human to read all the papers and select the relevant papers.

Hence using NLP we can find ranking of papers based on relevance to a specific question.

## Dataset:
The dataset of research papers is available on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/jagtapraj/covid-19-research-paper-ranking/data)

## Algorithms Used
1. GloVe vectors + Cosine Similarity
2. GloVe vectors + KNN
3. GloVe vectors + CNN
4. TF-IDF
5. Topic Modelling : EDA
6. BERT : Sentence Transformers
7. Text Summarisation
